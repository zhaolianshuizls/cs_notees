68. type hinting does not guarantee the type of the arguments or return type, just a hint, not a requirement
67. since classmethod can be called before creating a class instance, we can use it to create singleton or control the creation of instances
66. classmethod can have access to the class object, not the instance; staticmethod has no access to class or instance, just store some logic related to the class/instance in its body
65. syntactic sugar @ just takes the function object as the argument fed into the decorator, if the decorator return the original function object, then ok; if it returns a different function object which wraps the orignal one, then it will be different
64. [f"{k}={repr(v)}" for k, v in kwargs.items()], here repr() will print '' if v is a string
63. @functools.wraps(func) is interchangable with functools.update_wrapper(wrapper, func)
62. functool.update_wrapper(wrapper, wrapped) works just as @functools.wraps(func)
61. we can make class as an argument-taking decorator, which takes the arguemnt when constructing the class instance, and calls __call__ to decorate the method
60. decorate a function by more than on decorator, i.e. just stack decorators @x@b
59. @DECORATOR can also be used as a register, and not modify the function functionality
58. decorator with arguments, def timeit(_func = None, *, intval = 0); as _func and intval can not coexist/co-set, it natually deals with decorator with/out arguments
57. nonlocal makes a local variable in the inner scope a non-local, but also non-global, so the variable is referred as the one in the outer scope
56. def f(): f._b += 2; f._b = 0; defines a function attribute
55. functools.warps(func) keeps the wrapped function maintain their original signature
54. datetime.now().year/month/day/hour/minute/second
53. setattr(Me, 'name', 'zls'), delattr(Me, 'name')
52. in meta class, we can both control class creation and instance creation
51. in a class definition, __new__ can not control whether execute __init__ or not, so to create a singleton, we should do it through __call__ in the meta class
50. we can modify the attributes of a class in its meta class __new__ method
49. hasattr(Me, '__new__') or hasattr(me, '_a'); getattr(Me, '__new__') or getattr(me, '_a')
48. In the ordinary class, the class attributes can be modified in __new__, can not be modified in other methods
47. meta_class(type) -> __new__(mcls, name, bases, attrs), __init__(self, name, bases, attrs) -> controls the class creation
46. In meta(type) class, __new__ and __init__ are for class creation, while __call__() is for class instance creation, which calls __new__ and __init__ methods in the class definition; so to control the class instance creation, we can simply rewrite metaclass __call__ method
45. in order to save the changes made to the class attributes, we need to modify it in __new__ method, which is called before instance is created
44. create a class, cl=type.__new__(type, "Me", (object,), {'__init__': init_func}), do not call cl.__init__(...) as it's for instance initialization;
43. To add a function attribute to the object, it's better do it in the class level; while to add a value attribute to the object, we can simply do it in the object level if just this object needs it not the other objects
42. attributes in the class can be changed dynamically
41. if an object attempts to modify a class attribute, it just makes a copy of it, not really modify the class attribute
40. a.b here . implicitly put object a as the first argument in b if b is a function
39. the attributes of a class can be added dynamically, and the modifications are reflected on the objects created before the the modification taken place
38. class Me: pass; when creating a Me instance, Me() is equivalent to Me.__new__() and me.__init__()
37. the attributes of a class are the ones defined inside the class scope, like "def xx():..." or "_x=3"; while the attributes of a class object are the ones defined inside the methods, like in __init__() "self._a = 9..." or other functions, but they exist only after these methods are called; by obj._x=99 does not change the class attribute, it only defines _x as an attribute of the object, before which _x is not an attribute of the object, but obj._x will returns the attribute of the class if not exist in the object yet
36. class factories (create classes dynamically): type(name, bases_tuple, attrs_dict) returns a new class, which can be called like this cl()
35. super(Me, cls).__new__(cls) creates an object, if returned, its __init__() will be called
34. multiprocessing.Pool().map(fun, range(30)) keeps the order of the outputs as that of the intpus, but the execution can be arbitrary
33. multiprocessing.Pool(processes=3).apply_async(f, args=()) submits ${processes} processes at once, and continues running the rest f's when one or more processes are done
32. multiprocessing.Pool().apply(f, args=()) waits till f is done; [pool.apply() for _ in range(3)] actually runs f one by one serially
31. mulitprocessing.Manager() supports with statement, so outside of the with block, we can not use the manager object
30. multiprocessing.Process and multiprocessing.Pool differ: the former loads all tasks into memory, while the latter loads the specified number of tasks into memory and holds the rest queued tasks out of memory
29. map(f, range(9), range(3)) returns an iterator which executes f for each pair of elements from the two iterables. (terminates at the shortest iterator)
28. multiprocessing.Manager().list()/dict()/Value()/Array() works just as well as the mp counterparts, but all other synchronizing primitives are not working as expected
27. multiprocessing.Array('i', [2,3], lock=True) get_lock() to ensure the array is accessed by just one thread
26. multiprocessing.Value("i", 2, lock=True) creats a value in shared memory, by a.get_lock() we can acquire the lock and ensure process-safe for the value; for a character, it should be byte "{}".format(i).encode("utf-8"); to convert byte to string b"2".decode("utf-8")
25. multiprocessing.RLock() works just like threading.RLock(), but for the same process
24. multiprocessing.Lock() works just like threading.Lock()
23. multiprocessing.Process().terminate() kills that process
22. multiprocessing.Barrier() works just like threading.Barrier()
21. multiprocessing.Event() works just like threading.Event()
20. multiprocessing.Process() similar to threading.Thread(), both can be inherented from the base class
19. threading.Condition.wait_for(predicate, timeout) limits the maximum time to wait as timeout
18. threading.Barrier().wait(timeout) will throw a BrokenBarrierError if timeout is reached
17. threading.Event().wait(timeout) returns True if set() is called while it's waiting, False if set() is not called before timint out
16. threading.Condition() .notify() has to be for an already acquired lock, and only notify the threads that are already waiting on the lock; .wait() releases the lock and wait; supports with statement;
15. threading.Lock() supports context manager "with" statement
14. threading.RLock() not only ensures that only one thread access the critical block at a time, but also enables reacquiring the the same multiple times without requiring the outer lock released; the number of acquire() and release() has to be the same, otherwise it won't release the lock, so other threads won't be able to acquire the lock, thus deadlocking.
13. threading.Lock() ensures only one thread has the lock at a time, lock.acquire(); some_critical_code_block; lock.release(); when more than one threads are waiting, the subsequent thread acquires the lock after the previous one releases it
12. To exchange info through immutables, we need to make the immutables global in the scope where its value is changed.
11. To modify a global immutable in a function, we can in the function declare it as a global in order to avoid referenced before assignment error
10. threading.Barrier() blocks a set of threads until a certain number of them called wait(); it can be used recursively, i.e. as long as parties==n_waiting, all waiting threads are unblocked, and wait() can be reused again to form another blocking
9. threading.Event() can be used to synchronize threads. set() sets the event to be true; is_set() returns true if set() is called; clear() resets the event to be false; wait() blocks the current if the event is not set(); wait(timeout) blocks in timeout period
8. (ERROR, WRONG) To exchange information between threads, we should never use immutables, as they do not reflect the changes made by one thread in other threads
7. a = 9;
   def f():
	# the global immutable variable can only be referenced, not assigned, except mutables
	print (a) # throw "referenced before assignment" error
	a += 1
   
6. set attributes of an object, e.g. setattr(function_obj, "__doc__", "some docstring")
5. To be a closure, make sure nested function, reutrn function object, and at least one variable in the outer function is used inside. closure_obj.__closure__[0].cell_contents; [i] depends on the number of varibles enclosed
4. closure returns a different object whenever called
3. a=[2]; b = a[:] -> id(a) != id(b) -> deep copy
2. swap two values: a, b = b, a
1. "with CONTEXTMANAGER() as cm:" -> inside CONTEXTMANAGER(), __enter__(self), __exit__(self, excp_type, excp_value, excp_traceback) need to be implemented; __enter__() does not need to return anything
